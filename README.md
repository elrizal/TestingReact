## Tools Used
React, Webpack, Yarn Build, Material UI, Bootstrap, Custom CSS, Babel
## Changes from Mock-up
Since the first part of the form was not already sketched, I decided to add the first steps in, while sticking to the desired design formatting. 
## Process
I initially started with setting up the application through Webpack. From there, I instantly noticed how close the UI in the Zeplin mock-up was close to Material UI.com's library.
With some CSS gathered from the wireframe, I decided to format the logic based on the indications in color- so for example, in the top status of the form, I thought it would be most
intuitive to use ReactRouter to display each step. Upon reviewing the real form in the prompt, I also made the decision to make the initial step in a similar format to the ones already designed. For simplicity and time constraints, I also decided to have a flat-UI approach.
